# Unity Developer Test Task - Leaderboard Popup

For resolve this task i used Zenject, and added some small modify to PopupManagerServiceService. 
So now all popups creats from DiContainer, and i can add [Inject] attribute and use all Zenject instruments when i creted new popup.
Also i added cache for dowloaded images.
All my code is easy to undersatnd, and there are a small count of code,  so i think it's no problem for you to understand all i wrote.
